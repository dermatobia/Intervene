To test out,
$ rails c

Copy the content after the prompt

$ SchoolDistrict.first.school_county.name

If you put:
 pry(main)> SchoolDistrict.first.school_county_id.name

 You will get
 NoMethodError: undefined method `name' for 1:Fixnum

 Because id is just an integer, you need to call the object(?) and then ask for the properties that are in the object
